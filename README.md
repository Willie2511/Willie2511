## Hi  ðŸ‘‹


My name is Willie and I am currently working as a cloud native software engineer using technologies such as Helm, Kubernetes and Docker, but have experience in a number of programming styles and languages. 

I have a masters in Applied Software Engineering but have most recently studied Data Analytics at University level, where I have developed numerous new skills. 

The majority of the repositories publicily available on my account are Data Analytics projects. The pinned repositories on this homepage will be explained in more detail in each repository ReadMe file. 

I love to collaborate so do not hesitate to contact me with some project ideas. 

Also please find my LinkedIn profile attached where you can get a better idea of my skills and experience. 

Let's connect and start forming strong professional relationships.
